## What You'll Learn

- How to construct term_query queries
- Understanding query parameters and options
- How to interpret search results
- Best practices for using term_query queries

## Lab Features

### Query Editor
- **Edit Queries**: Modify the provided examples or write your own
- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and see results in real-time
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run queries
- **Copy Query**: Copy the current query to your clipboard
- **Add Highlighting**: Toggle highlighting to see matched terms in results

### Results Display
- **Results Tab**: View search results with key fields displayed
- **RAW JSON Tab**: See the complete Elasticsearch response
- **Tokens Tab**: Analyze how your query text is tokenized
- **Why? Button**: Click on any result to see why it matched

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset Tab**: View information about available indices and their fields
- **Index Selector**: Switch between different datasets to test your queries

## Examples

This lab includes 6 examples demonstrating different aspects of the term_query query:


### Find a product by exact ID
This query retrieves a product document with the exact product_id of '12345'.


**Try This:**

- Change the value of 'product_id' to another exact ID in your dataset and observe the results.




### Search for an exact product brand
This query retrieves all products that have the exact brand name 'Acme'.


**Try This:**

- Replace 'Acme' with another brand name to see if products from that brand exist in your data.




### Find reviews with a specific rating
This query retrieves all reviews that have a rating of exactly 5.


**Try This:**

- Modify the 'value' field to another rating (e.g., 4 or 3) to see reviews with that rating.




### Search for a verified purchase
This query retrieves reviews where the purchase is marked as verified.


**Try This:**

- Toggle the 'value' between true and false to see reviews for verified and non-verified purchases.




### Find a user by exact username
This query retrieves a user document with the exact username 'johndoe'.


**Try This:**

- Replace 'johndoe' with another username to find a different user.




### Find users based on trust score
This query retrieves all users with a trust score of exactly 90.


**Try This:**

- Change the 'value' to a different trust score (e.g., 80 or 95) to find users with that score.
