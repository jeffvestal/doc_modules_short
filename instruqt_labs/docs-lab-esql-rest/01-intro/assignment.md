## Examples

This lab includes 6 examples demonstrating different aspects of the esql_rest query:


### Filter and Sort Products
Filter products by category and sort them by price in descending order.


**Try This:**

**Try This:**

- Add additional interests like "Sports" or "Toys".

- Remove the LIMIT clause to see all matching users.




### Find Premium Priced Products
Find products with prices greater than $50, displaying their name and price.


**Try This:**

- Change the condition to product_price <= 50 to find cheaper products.

- Add a LIMIT clause to restrict the number of results.




### Find Verified Purchase Reviews
