## Examples

This lab includes 5 examples demonstrating different aspects of the range_query query:


### Find products in a specific price range
Search for products with prices between $30 and $60.


**Try This:**

- Change the range to find products over $60.

- Try setting only a lower bound (gte) to see products above a certain price.




### Filter reviews by rating
Retrieve reviews with a rating of 4 or higher.


**Try This:**

- Change the range to find reviews with a lower rating.

- Combine this query with a term query to filter by verified purchases.




### Search for recent reviews
Find reviews posted in the last 6 months.


**Try This:**

- Adjust the range to search for reviews from the last year.

- Try combining this with a range filter on review_rating.




### Find users by trust score
Search for users with a trust score above 70.


**Try This:**

- Change the range to find users with trust scores below 50.

- Combine this with a match query on interests to refine results.




### Filter products by price and boost relevance
Search for products with prices between $20 and $80, boosting relevance for mid-range prices.


**Try This:**

- Adjust the boost value to prioritize mid-range products even more.

- Change the price range to focus on luxury products.
