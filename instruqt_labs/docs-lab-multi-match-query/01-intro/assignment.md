# Multi-match Query Lab

Welcome to the interactive Multi-match Query lab! This lab teaches you how to use the multi_match_query query in Elasticsearch.

## Overview

The `multi_match` query builds on the `match` query to allow multi-field queries.

## What You'll Learn

- How to construct multi_match_query queries
- Understanding query parameters and options
- How to interpret search results
- Best practices for using multi_match_query queries

## Lab Features

### Query Editor
- **Edit Queries**: Modify the provided examples or write your own
- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and see results in real-time
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run queries
- **Copy Query**: Copy the current query to your clipboard
- **Add Highlighting**: Toggle highlighting to see matched terms in results

### Results Display
- **Results Tab**: View search results with key fields displayed
- **RAW JSON Tab**: See the complete Elasticsearch response
- **Tokens Tab**: Analyze how your query text is tokenized
- **Why? Button**: Click on any result to see why it matched

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset Tab**: View information about available indices and their fields
- **Index Selector**: Switch between different datasets to test your queries

## Examples

This lab includes 5 examples demonstrating different aspects of the multi_match_query query:


### Search across product name and description
Find products related to 'wireless headphones' by searching both name and description fields.


**Try This:**

- Try replacing 'wireless headphones' with 'premium speakers' to see different results.




### Search product reviews
Find reviews mentioning 'comfortable' and 'durable', searching across title and text fields.


**Try This:**

- Try modifying the query to 'stylish durable' to find reviews emphasizing style.




### Cross-field search for user interests
Search for users interested in both 'Electronics' and 'Books' across the interests field.


**Try This:**

- Replace 'Electronics Books' with 'Sports Outdoors' to find users with different interests.




### Weighted search across fields
Boost results from the product name field while searching 'wireless headphones'.


**Try This:**

- Adjust the boost factor on 'product_name^2' to prioritize this field more strongly.




### Search using phrase prefix type
Find reviews starting with 'durable' or 'comfortable' in the title and text fields.


**Try This:**

- Try replacing 'durable comfortable' with 'easy assembly' to find reviews with similar prefixes.
