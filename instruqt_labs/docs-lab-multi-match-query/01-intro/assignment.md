# Multi-match Query Lab

Welcome to the interactive Multi-match Query lab! This lab teaches you how to use the multi_match_query query in Elasticsearch.

## Overview

The `multi_match` query builds on the `match` query to allow multi-field queries.

## What You'll Learn

- How to construct multi_match_query queries
- Understanding query parameters and options
- How to interpret search results
- Best practices for using multi_match_query queries

## Lab Features

### Query Editor
- **Edit Queries**: Modify the provided examples or write your own
- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and see results in real-time
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run queries
- **Copy Query**: Copy the current query to your clipboard
- **Add Highlighting**: Toggle highlighting to see matched terms in results

### Results Display
- **Results Tab**: View search results with key fields displayed
- **RAW JSON Tab**: See the complete Elasticsearch response
- **Tokens Tab**: Analyze how your query text is tokenized
- **Why? Button**: Click on any result to see why it matched

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset Tab**: View information about available indices and their fields
- **Index Selector**: Switch between different datasets to test your queries

## Examples

This lab includes 6 examples demonstrating different aspects of the multi_match_query query:


### Basic multi-match query on product fields
Search for products with the phrase 'wireless headphones' in their name or description.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for other product features, like 'premium sound' or 'smartwatch'.




### Boosting specific fields
Boost the importance of the product name field when searching for 'smartphone'.


**Try This:**

- Experiment with different boosts, e.g., 'product_description^3'.




### Multi-match query on review fields
Search for reviews mentioning 'comfortable' or 'durable' in the title or text.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for reviews mentioning other qualities like 'affordable' or 'long-lasting'.




### Using type 'phrase_prefix'
Search for products with descriptions starting with 'wireless'.


**Try This:**

- Try changing the prefix to 'bluetooth' or 'smart'.




### Cross-field search for user interests
Search for users interested in 'Books' or related terms.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for other interests like 'Electronics' or 'Toys'.




### Tie breaker for multiple fields
Search for reviews mentioning 'great quality', balancing matches across title and text.


**Try This:**

- Adjust the tie_breaker value to see how it affects scoring.
