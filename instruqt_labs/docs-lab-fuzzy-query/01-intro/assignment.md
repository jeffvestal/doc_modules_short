# Fuzzy Query Lab

Welcome to the interactive Fuzzy Query lab! This lab teaches you how to use the fuzzy_query query in Elasticsearch.

## Overview

Returns documents that contain terms similar to the search term, as measured by a Levenshtein edit distance. An edit distance is the number of one-character changes needed to turn one term into another.

## What You'll Learn

- How to construct fuzzy_query queries
- Understanding query parameters and options
- How to interpret search results
- Best practices for using fuzzy_query queries

## Lab Features

### Query Editor
- **Edit Queries**: Modify the provided examples or write your own
- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and see results in real-time
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run queries
- **Copy Query**: Copy the current query to your clipboard
- **Add Highlighting**: Toggle highlighting to see matched terms in results

### Results Display
- **Results Tab**: View search results with key fields displayed
- **RAW JSON Tab**: See the complete Elasticsearch response
- **Tokens Tab**: Analyze how your query text is tokenized
- **Why? Button**: Click on any result to see why it matched

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset Tab**: View information about available indices and their fields
- **Index Selector**: Switch between different datasets to test your queries

## Examples

This lab includes 4 examples demonstrating different aspects of the fuzzy_query query:


### Find similar review titles
Search for review titles similar to 'durable'. Useful for identifying reviews with common misspellings or alternative phrasing.


**Try This:**

- Try changing 'durable' to 'durrable' or 'durbale' to test transpositions and edit distances.




### Search for similar user interests
Find users whose documented interests are similar to 'Books'. This helps identify users with close interests despite typos or variations.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for 'Boooks' or 'Boks' to explore how fuzziness handles input errors.




### Find products with similar descriptions
Search for products where the description is similar to 'premium quality'. This query helps identify products with closely related descriptions.


**Try This:**

- Try modifying 'premium quality' to include typos like 'premiom qualty'.




### Search for similar product brand names
Find products with a brand name similar to 'GlowEssence'. This is useful for locating brands with slight variations or common typos.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for 'GlowEsence' or 'GlowEsensce' to see how close matches are handled.





## Getting Started

1. Review the first example query
2. Click "Run Query" to see the results
3. Try modifying the query to see how results change
4. Explore the other examples to learn different features
5. Use the "Try This" suggestions to experiment further
