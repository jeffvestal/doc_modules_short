    Welcome to the interactive lab for the fuzzy_query query!
    
    Returns documents that contain terms similar to the search term, as measured by a Levenshtein edit distance. An edit distance is the number of one-character changes needed to turn one term into another. These changes can include: - Changing a character (box → fox) - Removing a character (black → lack) - Inserting a character (sic → sick) - Transposing two adjacent characters (act → cat)

# Fuzzy Query Lab

Welcome to the interactive Fuzzy Query lab! This lab teaches you how to use the fuzzy_query query in Elasticsearch.

## Overview

Returns documents that contain terms similar to the search term, as measured by a Levenshtein edit distance. An edit distance is the number of one-character changes needed to turn one term into another. These changes can include: - Changing a character (box → fox) - Removing a character (black → lack) - Inserting a character (sic → sick) - Transposing two adjacent characters (act → cat)

## What You'll Learn

- How to construct fuzzy_query queries
- Understanding query parameters and options
- How to interpret search results
- Best practices for using fuzzy_query queries

## Lab Features

### Query Editor
- **Edit Queries**: Modify the provided examples or write your own
- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and see results in real-time
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run queries
- **Copy Query**: Copy the current query to your clipboard
- **Add Highlighting**: Toggle highlighting to see matched terms in results

### Results Display
- **Results Tab**: View search results with key fields displayed
- **RAW JSON Tab**: See the complete Elasticsearch response
- **Tokens Tab**: Analyze how your query text is tokenized
- **Why? Button**: Click on any result to see why it matched

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset Tab**: View information about available indices and their fields
- **Index Selector**: Switch between different datasets to test your queries

## Examples

This lab includes 5 examples demonstrating different aspects of the fuzzy_query query:


### Find products with similar names
Search for products with names similar to 'wirless'.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for a misspelled product name like 'wirless' or 'prmium'.




### Find reviews with similar titles
Search for reviews with titles similar to 'comfrtable'.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for a common typo in review titles, such as 'comfrtable' instead of 'comfortable'.




### Find users with similar interests
Search for users with interests similar to 'Eletronics'.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for interests with a typo, such as 'Eletronics' instead of 'Electronics'.




### Find products with similar descriptions
Search for products with descriptions similar to 'wirelss'.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for a typo in product descriptions, such as 'wirelss' instead of 'wireless'.




### Find reviewers with similar names
Search for reviewers with names similar to 'AveryWilams55'.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for a misspelled username, such as 'AveryWilams55' instead of 'AveryWilliams55'.
