    Welcome to the interactive lab for the fuzzy_query query!
    
    Returns documents that contain terms similar to the search term, as measured by a Levenshtein edit distance. An edit distance is the number of one-character changes needed to turn one term into another. These changes can include: - Changing a character (box → fox) - Removing a character (black → lack) - Inserting a character (sic → sick) - Transposing two adjacent characters (act → cat)

# Fuzzy Query Lab

Welcome to the interactive Fuzzy Query lab! This lab teaches you how to use the fuzzy_query query in Elasticsearch.

## Overview

Returns documents that contain terms similar to the search term, as measured by a Levenshtein edit distance. An edit distance is the number of one-character changes needed to turn one term into another. These changes can include: - Changing a character (box → fox) - Removing a character (black → lack) - Inserting a character (sic → sick) - Transposing two adjacent characters (act → cat)

## What You'll Learn

- How to construct fuzzy_query queries
- Understanding query parameters and options
- How to interpret search results
- Best practices for using fuzzy_query queries

## Lab Features

### Query Editor
- **Edit Queries**: Modify the provided examples or write your own
- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and see results in real-time
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to run queries
- **Copy Query**: Copy the current query to your clipboard
- **Add Highlighting**: Toggle highlighting to see matched terms in results

### Results Display
- **Results Tab**: View search results with key fields displayed
- **RAW JSON Tab**: See the complete Elasticsearch response
- **Tokens Tab**: Analyze how your query text is tokenized
- **Why? Button**: Click on any result to see why it matched

### Dataset Information
- **Dataset Tab**: View information about available indices and their fields
- **Index Selector**: Switch between different datasets to test your queries

## Examples

This lab includes 5 examples demonstrating different aspects of the fuzzy_query query:


### Find products with similar names
Search for products with names closely resembling 'wirless'.


**Try This:**

- Change the value to 'wirless' or 'wirless headphones'.

- Adjust the fuzziness to '1' or '2' to see different results.




### Find reviews with slightly misspelled titles
Search for reviews with titles that are similar to 'comfotable'.


**Try This:**

- Modify the value to 'comfotable seating' or 'comfotrable couch'.

- Change the prefix_length to '2' to require the first two characters to match.




### Find users with interests close to 'Electronics'
Search for users whose interests are similar to 'Elctronics'.


**Try This:**

- Try searching for 'Books' or 'Elctronic gadgets'.

- Set transpositions to 'false' and observe the difference in results.




### Find products with misspelled descriptions
Search for products with descriptions similar to 'wirless connectivity'.


**Try This:**

- Change the value to 'wirless network' or 'wreless signal'.

- Use fuzziness 'AUTO' instead of '1' for dynamic edit distances.




### Find users with similar usernames
Search for users with usernames close to 'AveryWilams55'.


**Try This:**

- Change the value to 'CameronLopez20' or 'DakotaHernadez39'.

- Reduce max_expansions to '10' and observe fewer results.
